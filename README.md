+ rule number 1: keep all data file in `.csv` extension otherwise add its type to `.gitignore`
+ rule number 2: we use wiki log for book keeping so each one of us will update daily on wiki
+ rule number 3: make sure to name your `.ipynb` file with your name inside
+ rule number 4: when pushing changes to master, please checkout a branch and push to a remote branch, then create a Pull Request in order to publish your code. DO NOT PUSH DIRECTLY INTO THE MASTER!
+ rule number 5: have fun
